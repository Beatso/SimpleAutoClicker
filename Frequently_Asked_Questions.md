# Frequently Asked Questions

## Is the program safe?

Use the program at your own risk. If you don't trust me, do not use the program. If you'd like to view the source code of this project, look at [the script](https://github.com/Beatso/SimpleAutoClicker/blob/master/main.ahk) in this GitHub repository. If you'd like to use an uncompiled version of the code rather than the .exe file, see [How can I run the uncompiled program in AHK?](#how-can-i-run-the-uncompiled-program-in-ahk) below. I take no liability for any damage caused by the program. 

## Why is Minecraft quitting to the title screen when running the program?

You probably have the Minecraft setting Pause on Lost Focus enabled. Press F3+P in-game to turn this off.

## Can I run the program on Mac?

No. Simple Auto Clicker will never work on any operating system other than Windows. This is since it is written in [AHK](https://www.autohotkey.com/), a scripting language designed solely for Windows.

## Can I use this program on servers?

I strongly recommend that you only use this clicker for AFKing, but I can't control what you use this program for. You shouldn't use it on servers where auto clickers are not allowed for AFKing. You should never use the clicker for PVP on servers where hacking is not allowed. I take no liability for any damage (including bans) caused by the misuse of the program. It is your own responsibility to use this program morally.

## Can I change the hotkeys?

The hotkeys are not customisable using the app itself. If you would like to change them in the code 

## How can I run the uncompiled program in AHK?

If you do not trust the .exe file, it may be of value to run it in as an AHK file.  

1. Go to [autohotkey.com](https://www.autohotkey.com/) and download the setup exe file. Run it and the setup wizard will guide you through the process of installing AHK.
2. Go to [the latest release](https://github.com/Beatso/SimpleAutoClicker/releases/latest) and download Source code (zip).
3. Open the zipped folder, and find the file named `simpleautoclicker_beatso.ahk`. Run this file. You should now be running the program as usual.

## How can I compile the program myself?

You can use the Ahk2Exe tool. See the [docs page](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Scripts.htm#ahk2exe) or [this answer](https://superuser.com/a/989489).
