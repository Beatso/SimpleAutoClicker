If you do not trust the exe file, or you are getting an issue where the program will stop clicking when the window is not focused, it may be of value to run it in as an AHK file.  
This page will guide you through the process of doing this. Note this will only work on windows.

1. Go to [autohotkey.com](https://www.autohotkey.com/) and download the setup exe file. Run it and the setup wizard will guide you through the process of installing AHK
2. Go to [the latest release](https://github.com/Beatso1/SimpleAutoClicker/releases/latest) and download Source code (zip).
3. Open the zipped folder, and find the file named `simpleautoclicker_beatso.ahk`. Run this file. You should now be running the program as usual.
